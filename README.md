# Components in JS
Lecture activity in the Full-stack development course at NTNU.
The task was to create a custom HTML component using JavaScript, including a random "pull" list example as the usage for the component.

## Description
The project shows a random list you can "pull" items from. These items will become marked when they are pulled, which happens in a random order.
There is also a button for resetting the list back to normal.

You can add your own list by using the `<random-list>` custom component in HTML.
You can add `title` and `list` attributes, where the 'title' attribute is the title of the list - and the 'list' attribute is the list's contents. Split list items by comma ','.
